You can use this code for your own websites, but with attribution. 

I value keeping this site open source, but as you all know, _**plagiarism is bad**_. I spent a non-negligible amount of effort designing, developing and trying to perfect my website, and I am proud of it! All I ask is to not claim this effort as your own.

So, feel free to fork this repo. If you do, please just give me proper credit by linking back to my website, https://nimitaggarwal.com. Refer to this handy [quora post](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-bad-to-copy-other-peoples-code) if you're not sure what to do. Thanks!
